THE WORKFLOW

* write code on a text editor, I use Sublime, personally.
* to compile: click #MAKE.bat, it opens the terminal and puts in the compilation command for you.
* the terminal stays open, don't close it! Run your program from this same terminal window 
	( type example.exe, hit enter, TAB auto-completes based on what's in the folder.)
	>Why should I run the program from the terminal if I can just click the .exe in the folder?
	- Because then you retain the log of everything you puts() or printf() from your code after you close it, or when it invariably crashes.
	-ALSO, after you run the the program for the first time, and after you compile for the second time
	(by typing in "mingw32-make quick", or just copy-pasting it from when the batch file put it in for you) you can use UP/DOWN ARROWS to go back and repeat these earlier commands, so compiling and running become 2-keystroke operations. Not counting alt-tabbing from the text editor...
	This might seem like obsessing over tiny details, but these little efficiencies add up over years of devving!

>What's the "quick" after mingw32-make??
I have 4 compiler flags sets in my makefiles:
 -release: suppresses all warnings, gets rid of the console window.
 -quick: suppresses all warnings
 -debug: my personal selection of compiler warnings (not that helpful)
 -max: all warnings enabled (awful)



TO START A NEW PROJECT

* copy the template, rename the folder.

* open the makefile. It doesn't have an extention, don't add one, just open it in the text editor.
* every new code file (.c) needs to go in the OBJS list, no commas, just spaces
* SDL libraries need to be included and liked, SDL2_image and SDL2_ttf examples are in there, commented out
* change OBJ_NAME to be whatever you want. That'll be the name of the .exe file.

* If you're using any SDL libraries you need to go and copy the .DLLs to your project folder, they live in:
C:\SDL\SDL2_[LIBRARY]-[VERSION]\i686-w64-mingw32\bin
get all of them! For image, for example, you need SDL2_image.dll, zlib1.dll AND the specific ones for the image formats you'll be using (libjpeg-9.dll, libpng16-16.dll, etc...)
All of this also goes for the base SDL dll, in case you lose the one in the template, or when you update SDL.


*IF YOU'RE USING SUBLIME
learn CTRL+D and SHIFT+RIGHT-CLICK&DRAG.


WHERE DO I LEARN...
> C
	-The C Programming Language, 2E, AKA "K&R"
	-Learning C the hard way
> The C standard Libraries
	-https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/
> SDL
	-https://wiki.libsdl.org/FrontPage
> SDL libraries
	the header files are pretty well commented
	-( image lib, for example is at: C:\SDL\SDL2_image-2.0.5\i686-w64-mingw32\include\SDL2\SDL_image.h )
